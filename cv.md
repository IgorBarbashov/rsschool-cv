## Summary
My **learning goal** in RS-school - get strong knowledge in frontend development, create several project and expand my employment opportunities  And my **long-term professional goal** - to become a senior Frontend developer.

I am very close to the position of the RS-school that education can be high quality, accessible and free for all. And I would like to take part in the development of this community. So, **one of my goals** is to **become a mentor** of the next stages on these courses.

About my character I can say that I am a person who is completely immersed into the current work. Beside the work I spend all free time to learning computer science and upgrade my frontend-developer skills. I’m a pragmatic, usually easy get a new knowledge (especially in computer science). If I don’t understand something, I work hard and do everything to do my job completely. I have analytic skills and it easy to me to systematize information.
